- Resources: Resources on the same level recomended by AI or that you can upload on your own gathered in file and folder systems
- Setup: Setup for each subject with widgets from the other functions in the app
- Study timer: When you press this, it shuold ask you how long you wanna study 0-5 hours, it shuold ask you what your goal for the session is, what subject you wanna study youve already created (or create now). When that is answered it shall show a visual timer of a wheel going around and shrinking (yk the usual timer for pomodoro) for as long as you said (there shuold be a stop button for early exit too). When that is done it will promt you new questions: are the goals for that suvject of the week fuffiled (see list you created yourself) and let them click yes or no, is there an exam soon (show the countdown too and let them click yes or no), how hard was this study session 1-5, did you fuffill your goal for this session yes/no, what will you do next time studying this suvject txt, and you should be able to tick of small goals from the planning (for ex, read 2/100 pages and talked to the teacher tick box). It should also have preset templates you can create for these questions, for ex studying something new, repetition, doing old exams, long session, short session, etc. Aka you should be able to write down diffrent study plans for yourself. I also wanna put in some standard templates for suggestions here with links to certain resources. All questions they answer in study button should be stored in a sheet (so they can see what they were supposed to do next time etc). Under study session you should also be able to take notes, just like in the formula sheet: txt, pen if ipad, latex, code and pictures. When the study button timer is finished, make a bell sound (not to harsh of a sound) but should be repeated until user clicks on timer.
- Flashcards: Flashcards with spaced time repetion you can set to diffrent rates. Should support images and latex. Like Anki
- Bank: A bank of folders and files for note uploaded by the user like google drive
- Formula Sheet: Formula sheet tool supporting LaTeX, images, and drawings for quick reference, with AI suggestions for simplification and relevant content that the user can edit or add to too.
- Study Buddy AI Assistant: AI-driven 'study buddy' chat interface to advise the student with tailored recommendations for better handling studies. I wanna create specific prompts for it.
- Setup page: Setup page for username, password, payment plan etc

## Style Guidelines:

- A gentle medium-green evokes nature and growth, aligning with the 'garden' concept.
- A very light, desaturated green, providing a soft, clean backdrop.
- A lavenderto create contrast and a touch of kawaii aesthetics.
- OpenDyslexic, offering readability and a touch of warmth for both headlines and body text.
- Use gentle and playful icons and animations like gifs representing natural elements like plants, animals, and minimalist shapes for a kawaii and cottagecore feel. NO EMOJIS. Make it look hand drawn but simple.
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout inspired by Notion, Obsidian, and other modern productivity tools to create a minimalist interface that's easy to navigate and customize.
- Incorporate subtle animations, like a gentle fade or slide, during transitions and interactions to enhance user engagement without being distracting.
